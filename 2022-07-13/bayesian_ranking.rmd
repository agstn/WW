### [Data Challange](https://github.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays/tree/master/data/2022/2022-07-13) {data-height=225 .bgblue}

The treatment response of 12 treatments for major depression was investigated over 111 trials.  
Treatment response was defined as a **reduction of at least 50% from the baseline score on the  Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) or the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at week 8** (or, if not available, another time between week 6 and 12).  

The dataset supplied for this challenge contains the ranking probabilities of the 12 different treatments for depression from Ranks 1-12. Each “Rank” cell contains the probability of each treatment receiving that ranking (preferred direction = 1 i.e. a treatment being Rank 1 indicates it being the most effective).
